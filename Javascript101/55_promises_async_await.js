// Promises and Async/Await

// Asynchronous programming in JavaScript often involves handling asynchronous operations such as making HTTP requests,
// reading files, or querying databases. Promises and Async/Await are two approaches to handle asynchronous operations.

// In this file, we will explore Promises and Async/Await, their syntax, and how to use them effectively.

// Promises
// A Promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
// Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

// Creating a Promise
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Perform asynchronous operation
    // Call resolve(value) if the operation is successful
    // Call reject(error) if there's an error
  });
  
  // Consuming a Promise
  myPromise
    .then((value) => {
      // Promise resolved, handle the value
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Promise rejected, handle the error
    });
  
  // Async/Await
  // Async/Await is a syntactic feature introduced in ES8 (ECMAScript 2017) for handling asynchronous operations.
  // It provides a more synchronous style of writing asynchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
  
  // Defining an Async Function
  async function myAsyncFunction() {
    // Perform asynchronous operations
    // Use the "await" keyword to pause execution until a Promise is resolved
    // Use try/catch blocks to handle errors
    try {
      const result = await myPromise;
      // Handle the result
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error
    }
  }
  
  // Using Async Functions
  myAsyncFunction()
    .then((result) => {
      // Handle the result
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      // Handle the error
    });
  
  // Comparing Promises and Async/Await:
  // - Promises are chainable using .then() and .catch() methods, while Async/Await uses a more synchronous style.
  // - Promises are great for handling multiple asynchronous operations in parallel or in a specific order.
  // - Async/Await is useful when you have a sequence of asynchronous operations that depend on the previous result.
  
  // When working with Promises and Async/Await, keep in mind error handling, handling multiple promises,
  // and understanding how to properly handle asynchronous code flow.
  
  // That concludes our exploration of Promises and Async/Await in JavaScript!
  // Feel free to experiment and explore further with asynchronous programming techniques.
